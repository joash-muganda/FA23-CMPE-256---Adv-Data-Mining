# Image Data Mining: LBP

## Overview
This project focuses on the application of Local Binary Patterns (LBP) for image data mining. LBP is a powerful texture descriptor and is utilized here for analyzing images and videos. By running LBP analysis on given images, we extract histograms that serve as unique data signatures, providing insights into the textural properties of the image data.

## Objective
- Perform LBP analysis on provided images.
- Extract and collect histograms from these images, representing the data signatures of their textural features.

## Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)
- Libraries: OpenCV, NumPy, Matplotlib (for histogram visualization)

## Usage
1. Place the images you want to analyze in a designated folder.
2. Run the provided Python script `lbp.py` to perform LBP analysis on these images.
3. The script will process each image, compute its LBP histogram, and save or display these histograms for further analysis.

## LBP Analysis
Local Binary Patterns (LBP) is a simple yet effective texture descriptor. The LBP feature vector, in the form of a histogram, represents the distribution of micro-patterns like edges, spots, and flat areas in an image.

## Output
After processing, the histograms of the images will be:
- Displayed on the screen (or)
- Saved in a specified directory (depending on the script's configuration)
