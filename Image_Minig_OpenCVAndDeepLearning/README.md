# Image Data Mining with OpenCV and Deep Learning

## Overview
This project involves the application of image data mining techniques using OpenCV and deep learning models. The goal is to analyze a set of images, applying advanced computer vision and machine learning techniques to extract meaningful information and observe patterns.

## Objective
- Utilize OpenCV along with deep learning models for image data mining.
- Share observations and analyze image histograms derived from the processed images.

## Requirements
- Python (3.x recommended)
- OpenCV Python Library
- Deep Learning Libraries (such as TensorFlow or PyTorch)
- Jupyter Notebook (for `.ipynb` files execution)

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
pip install opencv-python
pip install tensorflow # or pytorch, depending on the model used
pip install jupyter

## Usage
1. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
2. Place your images in a specified folder within the project directory.
3. Open the Jupyter Notebooks (`SJSUDeepLearningFaceDetectionML.ipynb` and `SJSUFaceDetectionML.ipynb`) to run the analysis.
4. Execute the cells in each notebook to perform image data mining.
5. Observe the output which includes image histograms and other observations.

## Methodology
- **OpenCV**: Used for image processing and feature extraction.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Employed for more complex analysis like pattern recognition, face detection, etc.
- **Observations**: Key findings and patterns identified from the images are noted.
- **Histogram Analysis**: Histograms of the images are generated to understand the distribution of pixel intensities.

## Output
- Detailed observations from the analysis.
- Histograms and other statistical data visualizations for each image.
- Possible conclusions or inferences drawn from the data mining process.
